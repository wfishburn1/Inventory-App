**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The goal for the app I developed was to address the need for efficient inventory management, the target market being small businesses and private individuals. The objective was to provide a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and deleting items from the inventory, along with the ability to view the current inventory status at a glance.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app?** 

-Login screen for authentication.
-Database to store and validate login credentials.
-Home screen displaying current inventory items.
-Screen for adding a new item to the inventory.
-Screen for editing existing item details.
-Functionality to delete items from the inventory. 
-Functionality to log out.

**How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
My UI designs kept users in mind by ensuring simplicity, intuitive navigation, and clear labeling of functions. I found success by focusing on minimalism and prioritizing the most important actions for the user.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

The coding process involved breaking down the app's functionality into modular components and following best practices such as object-oriented programming and separation of concerns. Techniques like reusable components and clean code principles were employed to enhance maintainability and scalability. These strategies can be applied in the future to ensure code readability and facilitate future enhancements or updates.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

Testing was conducted at various stages of development to ensure code functionality and identify any bugs or errors. Unit tests were written to validate individual components and integration tests made sure there were no defects in interactions between components. This process helps vitally to discover issues early in the development cycle, ensuring a more stable app that users can enjoy.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

My challenges revolved around getting the code to maintain functionality after making a modification. I wasn't as much focused on innovation as I was functionality. 

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

A particular component where I demonstrated knowledge and skills was in implementing the RecyclerView for displaying inventory items. This required my database to successfully contain items and correctly display them on the second fragment using the recycler view resource.
